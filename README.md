**Linter errors as annotations, even for fork PRs.**

Wrap your linter invocations with [Problem Matcher][] [add/remove][] to let
GitHub actions detect any errors and warnings and show them as annotations. As
opposed to existing Actions which use the Checks API, this one works correctly
even for Pull Requests from forks, which is otherwise [problematic][problem]
and probably isn't getting fixed [any time soon][problem-detail].

[Problem Matcher]: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/problem-matchers.md
[add/remove]: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/commands.md#problem-matchers
[problem]: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/133
[problem-detail]: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/133#issuecomment-535514071

**Problem Matcher wrapper** works differently (and happens to be much simpler):

1. Tell GitHub Actions how to recognize errors in linter output
2. Run the linter, any way you like (run command, docker, another action, â€¦)
3. Tell GitHub Actions to stop looking for errors of this particular linter so
   that we can safely run other linters

A screenshot and an example (further down) is worth a thousand words:
